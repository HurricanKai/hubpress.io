Hi, so, you want to / are learning C#, also known as CSharp, or CS

So first We need to understand the

== Basic Structure of C#

If you know C++ you may know this, even thought its not the same.

First we got the

=== Namespace

```
namespace HelloWorld
{
 //Other Stuff Here
}
```

or
```
namespace HelloWorld { /*Other Stuff Here*/ }
```

as you can see C# doesnt cares about Lines, (Besides Comments).
There isnt anything more to this so
next, inside the namespace we have got the

=== Class

```
[Access Mod] class <name> 
{

}
```

So, Thats All, just that, You Coud add the Access Modifier (or how you wanna call it), but thats optional. But we will come to that later.

Next We have 3 Types. Fields & Properties first:

=== Fields & Properties

```
[Access Mod] <type> MyProperty { get; set; }
[Access Mod] <type> MyField;
```

Types are the Most Important Thing in Programming Realy, But ill explain them Later still.

So these are nearly the same.
The Field is actualy used to Store Your data, while The Property realy is used for Accesing it Outside your Class.

`{ get; set; }` is only a shortcut. behind that is acutaly an function every time, so the next Thing in the Class:

=== Functions

```
[Access Mod] [Function Mod] <type | void> <Function Name>([Parameters])
{
// Your Logic Here.
}
```

This looks Realy Complicated i know, but [Function Mod] Is nearly Never Present.

Parameters are basicaly Just and Field without Access Mod, seperated by Commas,

Functions can be Called Like This:
```
static void Main()
{
    MyFunction();
  
    int i = MyFunctionWithReturn();
    
    MyFunctionWithArgs(0);
}
```

What is all this? Well lets have a look Line-by-Line

```
static void Main()
```

That is, as you maybe have noticed, an function.
Main is the Application Entry Point, so The Function Called when Starting The Programm, `static` just means it can be Called Without an Instance Ref (We will see that in detail later)

`void` Means it Returns Nothing.

so below:
```
MyFunction();
```

this Just Tells Our Programm to Run Anything inside `MyFunction()` the `;` ends the Line.

*_Remark_*: *All* Logic Instructions Are Ended with an *';'*.

```
int i = MyFunctionWithReturn();
```

Represents a Function That Returns the Type `int` and how its read.

Technicaly you dont have to store the Result in an _local variable_

*_Remark_*: _local variables_ are just like fields, but only accesable inside the Function they are Definded in.

```
MyFunctionWithArgs(0);
```

This Represents a Function with Arguments. this Function takes an `int` as input, which then can be used inside the Function.

Its also Possible to Input an Variable, Field or Property.

And you can combine Returning & Arguments.

```
int i = GetI(i);
```

Wont Work because:

a) the Name `i` is already taken, so the Variable Definition wont Work.

b) its Not Possible to use an Undefined variable, which i is before its set by The Function `GetI(int i);` (Normaly an example with an int is named "i", just an common).

So, you want to get Into it now?
